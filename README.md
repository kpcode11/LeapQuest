# LeapQuest

*Award-winning 2D Platformer Game built with Unity & C#*

## Overview

LeapQuest is an **award-winning Unity-based 2D platformer game** designed for Android devices. The game challenges players to navigate through dynamic environments filled with AI-driven enemies, interactive elements, and fast-paced platforming mechanics. It showcases advanced **A\*** pathfinding for intelligent enemy movement, a **modular C# architecture**, and mobile-specific performance optimizations, ensuring smooth gameplay at **60 FPS** even on low-end devices.

## Key Features

* **2D Platformer Gameplay** – Fluid character controls, precise physics, and engaging level design.
* **Modular C# Codebase** – 15+ interconnected systems (player movement, physics, audio, AI, UI, inventory, and more) designed for easy maintenance and scalability.
* **A\* Pathfinding for AI Enemies** – Smart enemy navigation across complex terrains without compromising frame rates.
* **Android Optimization** – Platform-specific optimizations reducing memory usage by **30%**, ensuring high performance on mobile hardware.
* **Modular UI System with Scriptable Objects** – Seamless **pause/resume transitions** and **20% faster UI load times** on mobile.
* **Award-Winning Recognition** – Honored at a local game development contest for innovation and performance optimization.

## Architecture

LeapQuest follows a **modular and component-based architecture**, ensuring scalability and reusability:

1. **Player Controller** – Handles movement, animations, and physics interactions.
2. **AI System** – Uses A\* pathfinding for dynamic enemy behavior.
3. **UI Manager** – Scriptable object–driven UI transitions for performance efficiency.
4. **Audio Manager** – Modular sound system with event-driven triggers.
5. **Game Manager** – Oversees game states, level loading, and save/load functionality.
6. **Resource Optimizer** – Implements pooling and compression for memory management.
